Introduction to S3
What is Object Storage (Object-based Storage)?
Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures.
S3 provides you with **unlimited storage*.
You donâ€™t need to think about the underlying infrastructure
The S3 Console provides an interface for you to upload and access your data
S3 Object
Objects contain your data. They are like files. Object may consist of:
Key this is the name of the object
Value the data itself made up of a sequence of bytes
Version ID when versioning enabled, the version of object
Metadata additional information attached to the object
S3 Bucket
Buckets hold objects. Buckets can also have folders which in turn hold objects
S3 is a universal namespace, so bucket names must be unique (think like having a domain name)
You can store an individual object from 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes in size

# here we show some key command in S3

AWS S3 CLI Common Operations - Lab Notes
Setp1: #Step 1: Setting Up AWS CLI Environment
aws configure # Open CloudShell or Terminal
export AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT=on-partial #Enable Auto Prompt (Optional)
Step2: #Creating an S3 Bucket
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket benny-example  --region ap-southeast-2 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=ap-southeast-2 #Create a Bucket
aws s3api list-buckets --query "Buckets[?Name=='benny-example']" # List All Buckets
aws s3 cp "/workspace/AWS-SAA/object.txt" s3://benny-example/ # Upload a Single Object
aws s3 sync "/workspace/AWS-SAA/example" s3://benny-example/ # Upload Multiple Objects Using Sync
aws s3api list-objects --bucket benny-example --max-items 10
aws s3 cp s3://benny-example/object.txt "/workspace/AWS-SAA/" # copy and paste
aws s3 rm s3://benny-example/ --recursive # Delete All Objects in a Bucket Recursively
aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket benny-example #Delete an Empty Bucket

aws s3api head-object --bucket my-example-bucket-ab --key file.txt # Get Object Metadata
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket my-example-bucket-ab --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled #Enable Versioning on a Bucket
