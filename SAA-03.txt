Introduction to S3
What is Object Storage (Object-based Storage)?
Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to other storage architectures.
S3 provides you with **unlimited storage*.
You donâ€™t need to think about the underlying infrastructure
The S3 Console provides an interface for you to upload and access your data
S3 Object
Objects contain your data. They are like files. Object may consist of:
Key this is the name of the object
Value the data itself made up of a sequence of bytes
Version ID when versioning enabled, the version of object
Metadata additional information attached to the object
S3 Bucket
Buckets hold objects. Buckets can also have folders which in turn hold objects
S3 is a universal namespace, so bucket names must be unique (think like having a domain name)
You can store an individual object from 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes in size
